This project aims to analyze and predict tornado activities using historical weather data. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and trends in tornado occurrences, which can help improve prediction models for future tornado events. The project leverages machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools to deliver insights and predictive analysis.
